            We collect emails from customers who opt-in to promotional marketing material, such as online discounts, email coupons, or equivalent promotional offers that can be redeemed only at a store location.
            We use customer's emails to track lead data so we can see how we are doing on paid and unpaid advertising, website development, and other customer-acquisition/retention measures/statistics.
            In store purchases may be linked to an email for our records to further study and understand this information. We hold no payment information, or other sensitive information besides the email and Speedline (Greenway Car Wash LLC) in-store purchase history.
            Payment information is handled by our payment processing partners, which are subject to change. We always select payment processing partners with fee-efficiency, customer analytics, and customer safety in mind. We spend more time than any car wash we know in collecting and securing customer data.
